# Football Player Scouting and Analysis

## Introduction

Welcome to our football player scouting and analysis notebook! This project delves into the realm of football analytics, aiming to unravel insights into player performance, potential, and market value. Our objective is to offer valuable information to football clubs for enhancing their scouting processes and player development strategies.

In this notebook, we will:

- Explore the distribution of unique players across different football leagues.
- Examine the evolution of player performance over time.
- Apply machine learning algorithms for predicting player outcomes such as overall rating, injury likelihood, and market value.

## Business Model

Our business model centers around providing actionable insights to football clubs, enabling them to make informed decisions regarding player recruitment and development. Through data analytics and machine learning, we strive to:

- Identify promising young talents with the potential to become future stars.
- Predict a player's future performance based on various factors such as age, current skill levels, and injury history.
- Estimate a player's market value, aiding clubs in transfer negotiations.
- Assess the risk of player injuries, facilitating effective squad management.

## Data Overview

Our dataset combines hybrid data from the FIFA game spanning from 2018 to 2022, incorporating information from the top 5 football leagues worldwide (Premier League, Bundesliga, La Liga, Serie A, and Ligue 1).
